# A-Machine-Learning-Model-for-Predicting-Sertraline-like-Activities
This project created a machine learning model to predict the activity of paroxetine derivatives. By learning and comparing physicochemical, molecular descriptors, and ADMET properties, the model can determine if similar compounds exhibit analogous activity.
Install dependencies using pip_install.py
import import.py
model_selection.py is used for selecting the optimal model
Finally, run the optimized version of svm.py
