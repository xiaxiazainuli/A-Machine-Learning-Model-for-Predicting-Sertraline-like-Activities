# A-Machine-Learning-Model-for-Predicting-Sertraline-like-Activities
This project created a machine learning model to predict the activity of paroxetine derivatives. By learning and comparing physicochemical, molecular descriptors, and ADMET properties, the model can determine if similar compounds exhibit analogous activity.
